= Algorithms 2D

Some algorithms for working with 2D maps. Includes map generation, quick fill, intersect, blob detection and path finding (coming soon).

IMPORTANT: This code is *not* to be used in production. It can be used as a reference to create own stable algorithms.

Modified https://web.archive.org/web/20131025132021/http://kuoi.org/~kamikaze/GameDesign/art07_rogue_dungeon.php[rogue] algorithm for generating 2D dungeon map. Difference with original rogue is in that the rooms are having more random positions and dimensions, as well as shared walls. Example of map generated is below.

image::rogue80smallsquare.png[rogue80,300,300]

Attributes of the map that can be configured:

* Width and height of the map (w,h)
* Number of rooms in row and column (cw, ch), see below for explanation
* Min and max dimensions of the room (roomWidth, roomHeight)
* Disturbance (1-4, coming soon)

=== Usage

 Rogue rogue = new Rogue(w: 80, h:80, cw: 4, ch: 4, roomWidth: [10,25], roomHeight: [10,25])
 def map = rogue.generate()
 def someTile = map[20][20]

This will generate a room 80x80 tiles(pixels) with 16 rooms (4 rows with 4 rooms each) connected with corridors. All rooms are connected (there is always a path between any 2 rooms). `cw` and `ch` are parameters from original rogue algorithm. The map is divided into grid with `cw` columns and `ch` rows. Each cell in the grid will have room at 'random' position in the cell.
There is always an additional map (`debugMap`) generated, which contains cell boundaries and path used to traverse all rooms (to ensure that all rooms are connected).

 rogue.saveAsFiles(folderName)

will save both maps into png format (1 pixel per tile) into `foldername`, as well as text format. Below are some example of maps (and debugMaps) generated using this algorithm.
